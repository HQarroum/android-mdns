.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
(also known as
.Nm mdnsd
on some systems)
is a daemon invoked at boot time to implement Multicast DNS
and DNS Service Discovery.
.Pp
.Nm
listens UDP port 5353 for Multicast DNS Query packets.
When it receives a query for which it knows an answer,
.Nm
issues the appropriate Multicast DNS Reply packet.
.Pp
.Nm
also performs Multicast DNS Queries on behalf of client processes,
and maintains a cache of the replies.
.Pp
.Nm
has no user-specifiable command-line argument, and users should not run
.Nm
manually.
.Pp
To examine
.Nm Ns 's internal state, for debugging and disagnostic purposes,
send it a SIGINFO signal, and it will then dump a snapshot summary
of its internal state to
.Pa /var/log/system.log Ns , e.g.
.Pp
.Dl sudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder
